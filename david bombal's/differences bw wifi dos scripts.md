The provided Wi-Fi DoS (Denial of Service) scripts share a common goal: disrupting Wi-Fi networks by deauthenticating connected clients. However, they differ in implementation details, features, and complexity. Here's a breakdown:

### **Common Functionality**
All scripts:
1. Put the Wi-Fi adapter into **monitor mode** to capture and inject packets.
2. Use tools like `airodump-ng` to scan for nearby Wi-Fi networks and clients.
3. Allow the user to select a target network (BSSID and channel).
4. Use `aireplay-ng` to send **deauthentication packets** to disconnect clients from the target network.
5. Require **sudo/root privileges** to execute.

### **Differences Between Scripts**

#### **`wifi_dos_own.py`**
- **Features**:
    - Allows the user to specify MAC addresses of devices that should not be deauthenticated.
    - Uses threading to send deauthentication packets continuously for multiple clients simultaneously.
    - Includes helper functions for managing CSV files and Wi-Fi adapter modes.
- **Complexity**: High. It is more feature-rich and user-friendly compared to others.

#### **`wifi_dos_type1.py`**
- **Features**:
    - Focuses on simplicity.
    - Scans for networks and performs deauthentication on a selected network.
    - Does not include advanced features like excluding specific MAC addresses or multithreading.
- **Complexity**: Low. It is a basic implementation of a Wi-Fi DoS attack.

#### **`wifi_dos_type2.py`**
- **Features**:
    - Similar to `wifi_dos_type1.py` but uses `subprocess.Popen` for running `aireplay-ng` in the background.
    - Allows continuous deauthentication without blocking the script.
    - Slightly more robust than `wifi_dos_type1.py` but still lacks advanced features.
- **Complexity**: Medium. It is a slight improvement over `wifi_dos_type1.py`.

#### **`wifi_dos3.py`**
- **Features**:
    - Similar to `wifi_dos_type1.py` but uses `iw` commands for managing Wi-Fi adapter modes instead of `airmon-ng`.
    - Does not include advanced features like excluding MAC addresses or multithreading.
    - Focuses on simplicity and uses `subprocess.run` for most operations.
- **Complexity**: Low. It is another basic implementation with minor differences in adapter management.

### **Summary of What They Do**
1. **Scan for Wi-Fi Networks**: All scripts use tools like `airodump-ng` to list nearby Wi-Fi networks and their details (BSSID, channel, etc.).
2. **Select a Target**: The user selects a network to attack.
3. **Deauthenticate Clients**: The scripts send deauthentication packets to disconnect clients from the selected network.
4. **Optional Features**:
    - Excluding specific MAC addresses (`wifi_dos_own.py`).
    - Multithreading for continuous attacks (`wifi_dos_own.py`).

---

### **Key Differences**
- **`wifi_dos_own.py`**: Most advanced, supports multithreading and MAC exclusion.
- **`wifi_dos_type1.py`**: Basic, single-threaded, no advanced features.
- **`wifi_dos_type2.py`**: Slightly improved over `type1`, runs deauthentication in the background.
- **`wifi_dos3.py`**: Basic, uses `iw` for adapter management instead of `airmon-ng`.
